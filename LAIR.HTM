	When I was in the process of creating this action packed 
	Deathmatch level. I thought to myself the ideal deathmatch 
	arena would have mulitple sniper towers and traps of all kinds.

	This level has four main sniper towers. The four sniper tower 
	cover the whole arena. From these towers you can frag anyone 
	that is on the bottom floor. But the people on the bottom floor
	are not completly defenceless. They have walls that will 
	protect	them from the sniper across from them. Even thought the
	snipers have such an advantage, they still be counter attacked. 
	The people on the bottom floor can jump through the telleport 
	that brings them to a level above the snipers. So as you can 
	see, this level involves a lot of stragitict placing.

	This level contains traps of all sorts. One of the main traps
	in this level is the retractible floor. There is a button at 
	the top of one of the sniper towers, when activated retracts 
	the floor. Underneath the floor is a lava-pool waiting fpr the
	 poor souls. Might I say that it is a lot of fun to watch your 
	opponents scrambling around the lower level trying to find a
	lift or tellaport while the floor is slipping from underneath 
	their feet.
